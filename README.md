# BinSegML
Machine Learning Simulation with Experimental Quantization Method.
- This is just a proof of concept with MANY inefficencies. 
- This code was developed during the SBTR Summer Bridge to Reasearch Internship.
- This repo tries to implement the methods proposed in this [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Binary-segmentation-for-matrix-and-vector-Pan/47defb32ca0ff9db3564636d90505e5ad0323276#citing-papers).
